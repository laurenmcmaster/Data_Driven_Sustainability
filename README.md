# Data_Driven_Sustainability

## Introduction

In an era where environmental awareness is becoming more prominent, along with a need for sustainable energy solutions, I explore the intricate landscape of renewable energy production. Leveraging structured data and SQL-based analysis, my goal is to decipher historical trends in renewable energy sources, evaluate their efficiency, and delve into regional variations in their adoption. With a commitment to mitigating the impacts of climate change, this project aspires to equip stakeholders with insights that contribute to informed decisions and foster a cleaner, more environmentally responsible future.

## Key questions

1. **Renewable Energy Trends**
    1. How have historical trends in renewable energy production, including growth rates, varied for different renewable sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro)?
    2. Which renewable sources have experienced the most significant growth over time?
2. **Renewable Energy Mix Analysis:**
    - How has the composition of the renewable energy mix, including solar, wind, and hydro, evolved in different regions or countries over time?
3. **Regional Comparisons**:
    - What are the differences in renewable energy production and consumption across various regions or countries, with a specific focus on solar, wind, and hydro energy sources?
    - What factors underlie the variations in the adoption of these renewable energy sources among different regions or countries?
4. **Air Pollution and Renewable Energy Impact Analysis**
    - Is there a correlation between air pollution levels and the generation of renewable energy from solar, wind, and hydro sources?

## Data Collection:

Data was collected from three Kaggle datasets listed below:

- [CO2 Emissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country)
- [Renewable Energy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/belayethossainds/renewable-energy-world-wide-19652022?select=02+modern-renewable-energy-consumption.csv)

Each data source was uploaded to my SQL Server to create some new tables for easy analysis.
